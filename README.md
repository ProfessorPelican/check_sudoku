# check_sudoku

## Overall Purpose:
This can check if the Sodoku puzzle answer if valid.  In a Sodoku, all rows and columns must have 1 to 9 with no repeating numbers.  

The input is a list of lists.  An example valid Sodoku puzzle is included.

## Fun Fact!
I asked Chat GPT for a valid Sodoku puzzle in a Python list of lists to test my code.  It did indeed provide an answer, but it was wrong.  I asked three more times, and all were wrong except the final answer, which was finally right.  So, while Chat GPT is powerful, it is not very reliable.
